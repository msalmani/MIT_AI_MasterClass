### Goal 
**Identify customer churn for a telcom company using data science methods in R. R is one the most populare language among data scientists and statisticians.**

### Problem description
**Company X's revenues is based on a subscription service. As customer acquisition costs increase, the company sees management of existing customer churn as a key driver of increasing margins. Here, we aregoing to try to predict which customers are going to churn and what are the underlaying factors for that.
